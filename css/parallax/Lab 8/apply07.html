            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>In this tutorial, you will learn about Hypertext Markup Languange,
                 or HTML.</p>
            <p>Webpages are created using HTML, which is an authoring language
                 used to create documents for the web. HTML consists of a set of 
                 special instructions called tags to define the structure and layout of
                  content in a webpage. A browser reads the HTML tags to determine how
                 to dislpay the webpage content on a screen.</p>

            <h3>Your First Webpage</h3>
            <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create your first 
                webpage.</p>
                <p>You can create webpages using HTML with a simple text editor,
                    such as Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime, Programmer's Notepad, TextEdit,
                    and TextWrangler. Notepad come preinstalled with the Windows
                    operating system and TestEdit comes preinstalled with the Mac OS X
                    operating system. TextWrangler also runs only on Mac OS X, while the
                    other text editors run on Windows. A text editor is a program that 
                    allows you to enter, change, save, and print text, which includes HTML tags.</p>
